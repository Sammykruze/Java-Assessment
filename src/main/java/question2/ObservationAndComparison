COMPARISON

Non-concurrent version is simpler and easier to implement. All operators are performed sequentially.
 Also adequate for scenarios where user actions do not overlap.

Concurrent version allows realistic simulation of concurrent user actions, it is more complex due to synchronization
requirement.

OBSERVATION
In a non-concurrent version, the lack of concurrency ensure simplicity but does not reflect real-time concurrent user actions.
The concurrent version, while more complex, better simulates a real-world scenario where multiple users interact
with the system simultaneously. It ensures data higher-level concurrency utilities are not used.
